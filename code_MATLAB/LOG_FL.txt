=====2019/10/25=== meeting: FL, MM  === 
- Possible black box for optimal stopping in the current optimiation 

=====2019/10/25=== meeting: FL, Esther, Ciaran  === 
 + explained the Bayesian framework 
 + got questions about observation model answered; -->> for SSM and for optimal stopping in optimization


TODO list (FL): 
 - investigate the optimal stopping for optimization
 - Bayesian framework: MATLAB code
    + 1. sample the posterior by Sequential Monte Carlo type methods (DONE: good to run the current toy model, but computationally costly)
    + 2. Gaussian process regression (more efficient, but requires linear approximation --- which may not be accurate)
 - set up a mathematical framework, and develop methods/theory for the inverse problem. 
TODO (Esther)
  + A data set: a solution S(T,t) and observation C_Q(t); plot the climatological pdf of S; 


=====2019/10/25=== meeting with Esther  === 
- meeting summary: 
 + explained the state-space model framework (future direction)
   [Current optimization uses true initial condition, not possible in practice]
 + optimal size in the current estimation ()
 + about how to run python 

1. TODO list
  - made SMC/GP regression frame code in MATLAB: 
    + can I use the Fortran in Matlab 
    
  - how to run python modules: 
    + change the SAS function
    + random initial condition (instead of the truth)

=====2019/10/24 === meeting with Ciaran, Esther  === 
 -- set FL's role: 
  + NO longer on python coding; if needed, provide MATLAB code frame
  + math formulation of the problem;  
  + methods: optimal size and state-space model algorithm
